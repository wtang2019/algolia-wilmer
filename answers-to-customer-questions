Question 1: Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Answer: 
Hi George,
No problem I can surely help you with your queries.

Records are objects you would like to add to your search i.e. product articles, person, locations literally anything you would like to make it searchable
Indexing optimize the search operations on all the records you stored. 
Custom Ranking is very powerful to further tailor Algolia's capabilities to your specific business needs. Some of the examples includes popularity or rating.
